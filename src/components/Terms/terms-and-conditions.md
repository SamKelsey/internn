### 1. Definitions

Last modified: 30/03/2021

### **Terms and Conditions**

**"Booking Services"** means the services set forth in paragraph 4 of this Part 1, which shall be provided to you by Internn Ltd.

**“Company”** means Internn Ltd

**"Services Provider"** means a provider of photography services.

**"Website"** shall mean [www.internn.co.uk](https://www.internn.co.uk) and associated platforms which shall include, but not limited to, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

### 2. The Provision of Booking Services by Internn Ltd.

Internn Ltd. provides to you certain booking services (the "**Booking Services**"). The Booking Services include:

1. Accepting bookings requested by you in accordance with sub-paragraph 4 below, but without prejudice to the Company’s rights at its sole and absolute discretion to decline any such request and/or cancel an accepted booking;
2. Identifying suitable Service Providers;
3. Keeping records of bookings; and
4. Receiving and dealing with feedback, questions and complaints relating to bookings accepted by the Company, which may be made by email: enquiries@internn.co.uk. You are encouraged to provide your feedback if any of the services provided to you by a Service Provider do not conform to your expectations.

in each case in accordance with any relevant provisions of the Legislation.

Pursuant to, and for the purposes of the Legislation, the Company accepts bookings at its registered address and/or operating centres and is subject to all statutory and regulatory obligations and liabilities with respect to that activity.

### 4. Your Services Contract with a Service Provider.

The Company is not a Service Provider and does not provide photography and related services. Photography services are provided to you under a contract (the "**Services Contract**") between you and the Services Provider that is identified to you in the booking confirmation provided by the Company.

The Company is not a party to the Services Contract and acts as a disclosed agent for the Services Provider in communicating the Service Provider's agreement to enter into the Services Contract.

### 5. Payment.

The Booking Services are provided by the Company to you free of charge. The Company reserves the right to introduce a fee for the provision of the Booking Services. If the Company decides to introduce such a fee, it will inform you accordingly and allow you to either continue or terminate your access to the Booking Services through the Website at your option.

The rates that apply for the photography services provided by the Services Provider can be found on the Website. These may be modified or updated from time to time. It is your responsibility to remain informed about the current rates for the photography services.

### 6. Limitation of Liability.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company will not be liable to you in any way (whether such liability arises in contract (by way of indemnity or otherwise), tort (including negligence) misrepresentation, breach of statutory duty, restitution or otherwise) for: any theft or loss of your or any other person's property in connection with the Booking Services or any booking accepted by the Company. The Company will not be liable for any and all of the following;

a. any booking that has not been accepted;

b. any loss, damage, costs, expenses or liability suffered by anyone other than you in connection with your use of the Website;

c. any losses that could not reasonably be expected to result from our negligence or breach of these Terms and Conditions;

d. any loss relating to your business or the business of your employer or any other person;

e. any loss of profits, loss of revenue, loss of opportunity, loss of business or employment (whether or not such loss could be reasonably expected to flow from our negligence or breach of these Terms and Conditions); or

f. any other loss, damage, costs, expenses or liability that you suffer in connection with the Booking Services, save to the extent that the Company fails to perform its obligations to you to the standard of a diligent and professional provider of the relevant services.

g. If the Company is liable to you in connection with the Booking Services, its liability will be limited to an amount equal to £250 in aggregate.

Nothing in these Terms and Conditions will limit or exclude the Company’s liability to you for personal injury or death caused directly by the Company’s negligence.

### 7. Applicable Law.

The Booking Services and the Booking Service Terms set out in this Part 1, and all non-contractual obligations arising in any way whatsoever out of or in connection with the Booking Service Terms shall be governed by, construed and take effect in accordance with the laws of Scotland.

Any dispute, claim or matter of difference arising out of or relating to the Booking Services or Booking Service Terms is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Scotland.

## Part 2 – Terms of Use

These Terms of Use (“_Terms_”) apply to your visit to and your use of the Website as well as to all other information, recommendations and/or services provided to you on or through the Website, but for the avoidance of doubt these User Terms do not apply to the Booking Services defined and described in Part 1 above. However, defined terms used in this Part 2 shall have the meaning given in Part 1 unless otherwise specified.

### 1. Contractual Relationship

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES.

Your access and use of the Services constitutes your agreement to be bound by these Terms, which establishes a contractual relationship between you and the Company. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with you. The Company may terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason. The Company will provide you with as much notice as it reasonably can of such termination, cessation or denial, being at least 24 hours notice. However, the Company reserves the right to terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, immediately at any time without notice if (i) you are in breach of these Terms, (ii) it is impractical to give such notice in the circumstances, or (iii) in the Company’s opinion, any delay in such termination would expose the Company or a third party to significant risk of harm or damage.

Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, activity or promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable Services. Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes of the applicable Services. Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services.

The Company may amend the Terms related to the Services from time to time. Amendments will be effective upon the Company’s posting of such updated Terms at this location or the amended policies or supplemental terms on the applicable Service. Your continued access or use of the Services after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.

Our collection and use of personal information in connection with the Services is as provided in the Company’s Privacy and Cookie Policy located at www.internn.co.uk. The Company may provide to a claims processor or an insurer any necessary information (including your contact information) if there is a complaint, dispute or conflict, which may include an accident, involving you and a Third Party Provider (including a Services Provider) and such information or data is necessary to resolve the complaint, dispute or conflict.

### 2. The Services

The Services constitute a technology platform that enables users of the Company’s websites provided as part of the Services (each, an “_Application_”) to pre-book and schedule photography services with independent third party providers of such services, including independent third party service providers (including Service Providers as defined in Part 1). Unless otherwise agreed by the Company in a separate written agreement with you, the Services are made available solely for your personal, non-commercial use. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT PROVIDE PHOTOGRAPHY AND ANY RELATED SERVICES OR FUNCTION AS A SERVICE PROVIDER AND THAT ALL SUCH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS WHO ARE NOT EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES.

###### **License.**

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, the Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferable license to: (i) access and use the Services on your personal device solely in connection with your use of the Services; and (ii) access and use any content, information and related materials that may be made available through the Services, in each case solely for your personal, non-commercial use. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by the Company and it’s licensors.

### 3. Your Use of the Services

###### **User Accounts.**

In order to use most aspects of the Services, you must register for and maintain an active personal user Services account (“_Account_”). You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18), to obtain an Account. Account registration requires you to submit to the Company certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number and age, as well as at least one valid payment method (either a credit card or accepted payment partner). You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the Services or the Company’s termination of this Agreement with you. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by the Company in writing, you may only possess one Account.

###### **User Requirements and Conduct.**

The Service is not available for use by persons under the age of 18.

You agree to comply with all applicable laws when using the Services, and you may only use the Services for lawful purposes. You will not, in your use of the Services, cause nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience, or property damage, whether to the Third Party Provider or any other party.

You may opt-out of receiving text (SMS) messages from the Company at any time by following the directions found at enquiries@internn.co.uk. You acknowledge that opting out of receiving text (SMS) messages may impact your use of the Services.

###### **Promotional Codes.**

The Company may, in its sole discretion, create promotional codes that may be redeemed for Account credit, or other features or benefits related to the Services and/or a Third Party Provider’s services, subject to any additional terms that the Company establishes on a per promotional code basis (“ _Promo Codes_”). You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public forum or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by the Company; (iii) may be disabled by the Company at any time for any reason without liability to the Company; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that the Company establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use.

###### **User Provided Content.**

The Company may, in its sole discretion, permit you from time to time to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available to the Company through the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content and information, including commentary and feedback related to the Services, initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for competitions and promotions (“_User Content_”). Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to the Company, you grant the Company a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and the Company’s business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant the Company the license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content nor the Company’s use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.

You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law. The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove User Content, at the Company’s sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, without notice to you.

###### **Network Access and Devices.**

You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network’s data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from a wireless-enabled device and you shall be responsible for such rates and fees. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto. The Company does not guarantee that the Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or devices. In addition, the Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.

### 4. Payment

You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider (“_Charges_”). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Services, the Company will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as disclosed payment collection agent for the Third Party Provider (as Principal). Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by the Company. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. The Company will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.

All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated as soon as practicable by the Company using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which the Company will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that the Company may, as the Third Party Provider’s disclosed payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.

As between you and the Company, the Company reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in the Company’s sole discretion. The Company may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider’s arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee. The current cancellation policy applicable in the UK can be found at the Company Website.

This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods provided. The Company does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.

### 5. Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity.

THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LIABILITY OR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF: (i) YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON THE SERVICES OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; OR (ii) ANY TRANSACTION OR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDER, EVEN IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAY OR FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE RESULTING FROM CAUSES BEYOND THE COMPANY’S REASONABLE CONTROL. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES AND CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS(£250).

THE COMPANY’S SERVICES MAY BE USED BY YOU TO REQUEST AND SCHEDULE PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES WITH THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, BUT YOU AGREE THAT THE COMPANY HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY TO YOU RELATED TO PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS.

THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMER IN THIS SECTION 5 DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER YOUR RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

###### **Indemnity.**

You agree to indemnify and hold the Company and its officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or in connection with: (i) your use of the Services or services or goods obtained through your use of the Services; (ii) your breach or violation of any of these Terms; (iii) the Company’s use of your User Content; or (iv) your violation of the rights of any third party, including Third Party Providers.

You give your approval to the Company for it to assign or transfer these Terms in whole or in part, including to: (i) a subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) an acquirer of the Company’s equity, business or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger. No joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between you, the Company or any Third Party Provider as a result of the contract between you and the Company or use of the Services.

If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, under any law, such provision or part thereof shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of these Terms but the legality, validity and enforceability of the other provisions in these Terms shall not be affected. In that event, the parties shall replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof with a provision or part thereof that is legal, valid and enforceable and that has, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof, given the contents and purpose of these Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and replaces and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or undertakings regarding such subject matter. In these Terms, the words “including” and “include” mean “including, but not limited to.”
